Beyond Snowdenia

### The 3rd year of Snowdenia - Caroline Wilson Palow

* The last few years have been exciting for those watching how the Government deal with the issue of surveillance, and making sure the surveillance is consistent with human rights obligations
* Snowden has taught us that Governments have obtained much more surveillance power than we thought they had
* One significant form is known as mass surveillance, performed in the US and UK, to intercept every cable possible, including undersea cables, collecting as much data as possible
* In the UK the mass surveillance program is called Tempora, in the US it is called Upstream
* Other countries also do this such as Sweden that passed new wiretapping legislation in collaboration with the NSA, particularly concerning their geographical proximity to Russia
* This should have not surprised us considering the price of storage and memory dropping so severely in the last decade
* Our laws surrounding government surveillance, primarily RIPA, have not kept up with technical progression
* US Supreme Court on whether US law enforcement can attach a GPS device to someone's car and follow them around. Previously it took eight Police officers and a lot of money to do so would only take place in special circumstances, but GPS makes it cheap and easy yet the law considers it just as legal.
* In the past spies have been concerned about content, such as phone calls or emails, but now it turns out they are also committed to metadata which is apparently much more useful
* Also due to the rise of consumer encryption, making it harder to get the content
* Government hacking, or network exploitation, not admitted to previously but uncovered by Snowden
* In the US the USA Freedom Act reduced the NSA's capability to collect metadata
* Netherlands, France, Germany and Brazil also having surveillance discussions due to Snowden

### RIPA 2? - Ian Brown

* UK Surveillance programs have been criticised in the past by organisations such as Privacy International, but much more publicly in recent years thanks to Snowden revelations

    >   "Ripa, obscure since its inception, has been patched up so many times as to make it incomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates. A multitude of alternative powers, some of them without statutory safeguards, confuse the picture further. This state of affairs is an undemocratic, unneccessary and - in the long run - intolerable" - David Anderson Q.C, Independent reviewer of Terrorism Legislation

* The legislation is so vague to allow GCHQ to make large collections without having to reveal sources and methods
* Both the ISC's report and the Anderson report agree the legislation needs a complete overhaul

    >   "Should be structured and expressed so as to enable its essentials to be understood by intelligent readers across the world" - David Anderson

* The ISC recommends ministers continue to authorise interception whereas Anderon recommends it to only be authorised by a Judicial Commissioner
* Both reports recognise sensitivity of communications data, not just content or metadata
* Both reports recommend maintaining bulk interception programs but with safeguards unlike human rights groups
* Anderson extra recommendations:
    * Keep data retention for up to a year
    * Make ISPs should be monitoring communications on overseas services
    * Enter discussions with industry for other ways to collect data from services based outside the UK
    * Aim to create a group of likeminded democratic nations that share important data on suspects

### Privacy: I do not think that word means what you think it means â€” Kat Matfield

* Users hated the idea that they were about to give more data to Facebook if their product used a Facebook login
* One in twenty five people a year are subject to credit or debit card fraud, but when you ask them if it will happen to them they don't think lightning will strike twice
* The public perception of card fraud is against a targeted individual, not buying batches of credit card data and trying them all
* They believe the only people motivated enough to do that would be people they know, misrepresenting how little effort is needed for card fraud in modern times
* When asked to categorise their data, some of it as private, most of the information classed as private was easy to find out on the internet about each individual
* Some people were happy to trade personal data for free services, and some were less happy but still willing
* When told that their data would be regularly sold on they got more upset, and wanted a share of the money
* Once that had been learnt, more focus was put on being upfront so users could make informed tradeoffs
* When talking to users about encryption and security they didn't really care, but by putting visual padlocks on products and services people felt more secure
* Web design version of what the TSA do in US airports, very apparent security measures and fuss which don't do much for actual security
