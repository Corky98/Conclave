The Return of Christ
====================

Brian Brodersen - 7th August 2015
---------------------------------

* Many say Jesus failed to accomplish anything but the story isn't over yet
* Prophecies on the Messiah suffering and dying were not understood by Jewish scholars
* The second coming is yet to be fulfilled
* Presentation of Christ in the Gospels
* First three stages of New Testament:
    1. The book of Acts shows the proclamation of Christ
    2. The Epistles interpret Christ
    3. The Greek word for *revelation* means *apocalypse*

* Revelations tells the history of events leading to the conclusion of history, carries us all the way to an eternal state in Heaven
* If Revelation is only abstract describing the second coming, then why is it so descriptive? It has to be literal
* Revelation 1:19
        
    > **19** Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
        
* Second and third chapters pertaining to the Church
* Things that you have seen *(Chapter 1)*,things that are *(of the church)* *(Chapters 2&3)*, after the church *(Chapter 4 onwards)*
* Jesus is to come back to fierce opposition *(Isaiah 9)*
* Humans will embrace an incarnated Satan as their leader, **the Antichrist**, among many antichrists who reject Jesus
* The Antichrist, *the Beast*, will have a false prophet paired with them
* Opposition to the Gospel in radical Islam and radical Humanist Secularism; it will reach a climax in one person
* Hitler appears as a prototype who hates the Jews and followers of Christ but also had economic solutions which made the people trust him
* Isaiah 13:9-12

    > **9** Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
    > **10** For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
    > **11** And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
* Zechariah 14:1-5
        
    > **1** Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
    > **2** For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
    > **3** Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
    > **4** And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
    > **5** And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.

* Revelation 19:11-13
        
    > **11** And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
    > **12** His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
    > **13** And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
    > **14** And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
    > **15** And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
    > **16** And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, **KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.**

* Jesus was humiliated and suffered, but that time comes to an end. The Lamb in humiliation becomes to Lion of Victory
* Revelation 19:17-20

    > **17** And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
    > **18** That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.
    > **19** And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.

* The army of Satan will try to fight God with the weapons that man has created
* The Battle of Armageddon will most probably take place in the Valley of Megiddo, a major battle ground in Israel. All of this will happen in Israel
* Revelation 19:20

    > **20** And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire

* Men want Peace, but they don't want a peace with a righteous standard dependant on God
* Tirbulation 6-19
* Establishment of Kingdom of God chapter 20
* Revelation 20:1-3

    > **1** And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
    > **2** And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
    > **3** And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

* In the history of the church some theologians said Israel was dead, and the prophecies not yet fulfilled now apply to the church. Now Israel is restored those prophecies can be fulfilled
* Isaiah 11

    > **1** And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
    > **2** And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;
    > **3** And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:
    > **4** But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
    > **5** And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
    > **6** The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
    > **7** And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
    > **8** And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
    > **9** They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
    > **10** And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.
    > **11** And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
    > **12** And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
    > **13** The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.
    > **14** But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
    > **15** And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod.
    > **16** And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

* For a thousand years there will be a perfect environment, yet Satan will be able to gather a multitude against Christ because the problem is our rebellion
* Revelation 20:10-15

    > **11** And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
    > **12** And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
    > **13** And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
    > **14** And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
    > **15** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

* Satan's armies will be obliterated and at the White Throne everyone who has refused to submit to God's authority in the history of time will be judged
* A new Heaven and a new Earth will then exist; an eternity of purity
* Revelation 11:15

    > **15** And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

* Earth is getting worse and worse, repeating the same foolish mistakes; but the prophets remind us it will not always be this way
* Revelation 21:3-7

    > **3** And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
    > **4** And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
    > **5** And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
    > **6** And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
    > **7** He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.

* We do not know when he is coming, but Jesus said there would be signs, and much of what we see today fits these signs
* As certainly as Jesus came and died for us, he will come back to the very place and set up an **eternal kingdom.**
