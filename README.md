## What is Conclave?
Conclave is a collection of notes I have made in full markdown format available for public reading. In the case of quoting from copyright sources such as textbooks I will attempt to remain under a fair use limitation. Those self limits will not exist on Creative Commons or Public Domain content. For quotation of biblical sources I will solely use the **KJV** as it is in the Public Domain, unlike the NIV which is largely limited on public use.

These are my notes on any subject. If you have corrections please contribute them as taking notes is always complex.
