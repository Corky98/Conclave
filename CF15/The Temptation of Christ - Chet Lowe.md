* Matthew 3:1-17

    >   **1** In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
        **2** And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
        **3** For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
        **4** And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
        **5** Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,
        **6** And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
        **7** But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
        **8** Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
        **9** And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
        **10** And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
        **11** I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:
        **12** Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
        **13** Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
        **14** But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
        **15** And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
        **16** And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
        **17** And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

* Jesus is filled by the Spirit to be tempted, so that he can be made stronger
* Wind can be heard and its effects seen, but you can't see it
* If you want to do spiritual things, you need spiritual disciplines, and the disciples learnt that lesson when they were unable to perform miracles
* All those who want to live a Godly life will be persecuted and attacked by the Devil
* Faith is the victory but faith comes through the word of God
* Matthew 4:1-11

    >   **1** Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
        **2** And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
        **3** And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
        **4** But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
        **5** Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
        **6** And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
        **7** Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
        **8** Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
        **9** And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
        **10** Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
        **11** Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.

* Satan says turn these stones into bread to prove you are the Son of God, and Jesus replies man shall not live by bread alone. He is not tempted.
* You must know your enemy
* Satan is like the mosquito; He is persistent and attacks from all sides
* Satan is persuasive with his argument
* Satan is a poser; he is not a red devil with horns, that is a caricature to trick you into thinking he is not real
* Mark 4:3-20
    
    >   **3** Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
        **4** And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
        **5** And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
        **6** But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
        **7** And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
        **8** And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
        **9** And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
        **10** And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
        **11** And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
        **12** That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
        **13** And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
        **14** The sower soweth the word.
        **15** And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
        **16** And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
        **17** And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.
        **18** And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
        **19** And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
        **20** And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

* The word of God should be etched in our hearts, and not be taken away by Satan
* Luke 4:34-36

    >   **34** Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.
        **35** And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.
        **36** And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
