* Mark 1:1-11

    >   **1** The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
        **2** As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
        **3** The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
        **4** John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
        **5** And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
        **6** And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
        **7** And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
        **8** I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
        **9** And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
        **10** And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
        **11** And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

* Matthew 3:13-17

    >   **13** Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
        **14** But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
        **15** And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
        **16** And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
        **17** And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

* John 1:29-34

    >   **29** The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
        **30** This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
        **31** And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
        **32** And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
        **33** And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
        **34** And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

* Luke 3:21-38

    >   **21** Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
        **22** And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
        **23** And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,
        **24** Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph,
        **25** Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge,
        **26** Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda,
        **27** Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,
        **28** Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er,
        **29** Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,
        **30** Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim,
        **31** Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David,
        **32** Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson,
        **33** Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda,
        **34** Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,
        **35** Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,
        **36** Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,
        **37** Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan,
        **38** Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

* Genesis 1:27-28

    >   **27** So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
        **28** And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

* Genesis 12:1-3

    >   **1** Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
        **2** And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
        **3** And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

* Exodus 4:22

    >   **22** And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:

* Israel, the promised land, is a land bridge thirty miles wide between three major continents
* Any nation that passed through saw the perfection of Israel and attributed it to God
* The Israelites disobeyed God many times
* 2 Samuel:7-14

    >   **14** I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:

* For God to fulfil all righteousness, he had to keep the promise to Israel
* Jesus' Baptism was to submerge himself in God's Story, the human race, and to be an Israelite to fulfil Israel's prophecy
