Has Science Buried God?
=======================

John Lennox - 2nd August 2015
-----------------------------

### Part 1
* Nobel Prize won by Peter Higgs, an atheist
* Also won by William Philips, a Christian
* Conflict not between Science and God, but diametrically opposed views
* Ancient Greeks believed everything is *atomos* or space, **materialist**, versus Plato and Socrates believing the ultimate reality is God, *theism*
* The word **proof** has two meanings: mathematical, where everything is rigorously tested, and natural proof based on evidence
* Christianity gave birth to modern science because they believed in natural law
* Abstract science did not rise in Chinese culture because they did not believe in a creator
* Stephen Hawking and Isaac Newton shared same post at Cambridge; Newton saw gravity as a wonder of God, Hawking saw that now we know how gravity works we don't need a God to explain it
* To compare God and Santa Claus, as Dawkins does, is absurd; the greatest scientists in history believed in God not Santa
* Richard Dawkins is not a psychiatrist, and expert psychiatrists disagree
* If you look at it scientifically the evidence of benefits of faith on health are overwhelming
* A lot of atheism is based on assertion not evidence

    >   "Religion is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark"
        - Stephen Hawking

* Atheism is a fairy story for people afraid of the light says Lennox
* If you think God is a God of the gaps then he has to be opposed to science, which is a misunderstanding
* In Eastern cultures of ancient times, the Gods descended from the Heavens, whereas God created the Heavens and the Earth
* The more you understand Art the more you appreciate a Rembrandt, the more you understand engineering the more you appreciate a Rolls Royce

### Part 2
* How is it that people believe that everything came **from nothing?**
* Resistance against the discovery of the beginning of spacetime, shown by the editor of Nature saying it would give *too much leverage* to Christians
* Because there is a law of gravity, the Universe *can and will* create itself
* The laws of gravity don't create anything, they can only describe it
* Atheists believe that Miracles violate the laws of nature so the work of Jesus is wrong
* This does not take into account God can add in extra events with no laws being broken
* Do you like faith schools? Which kind? Christian faith schools, Muslim faith schools, Atheist faith schools?
* Atheism **will always be** a belief system
* Suffering and death is the hardest question to Christianity; non belief just removes the intellectual problem
* Beauty and barbed wire
* How do you find evidence in the Universe that God knows the answer to suffering?
* Justice cannot exist in an atheist worldview but it will be done on judgement day and it was done when Jesus died on the cross
* Atheists can't even define suffering because **what is, is**
