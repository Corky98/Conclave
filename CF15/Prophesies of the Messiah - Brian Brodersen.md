* Genesis 3:14-15

    >   **14** And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
        **15** And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

* The child of a woman will crush Satan

    >   "Now the story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened"
        - C.S. Lewis

* Jesus pre-existed, and came into the world to fulfil many Jewish prophecies
* The Saviour was prophesied to be a descendant of Abraham
* Micah 5:2

    >   **2** But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.

* The Saviour was to be born in Bethlehem
* Isaiah 7:14

    >   **14** Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

* Isaiah 9:6

    >   **6** For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
    
* Daniel 7:13

    >   **13** I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.

* Isaiah 35:10

    >  **10** And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

* Isaiah 11:6

    >   **6** The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

* Isaiah 53:3-5

    >   **3** He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
        **4** Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
        **5** But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

* Prophecies spoke of his rejection as well
* Isaiah 53 uses language many would associate with the New Testament
* Isaiah first spoke of a dying Messiah, not Paul
* Jesus is to be numbered with the transgressors
* State would have disposed of a criminal's body but Jesus' body put in tomb by Joseph of Aramathea as prophesied
* Psalm 16:10

    >   **10** For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

* Death was destroyed by Jesus when he defeated sin, prophesied in Psalm 16
